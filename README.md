# UVAGuide

UVAGuide is a Django web application to help University of Virginia students find their classes and plan their schedules. Students can use the mapping feature to plan their route to their classes or other places around the Charlottesville area. Additionally, users can utilize the calendar feature to plan classes and other events and enter their locations which can be used in the mapping feature.

This project was created with a team of four other undergraduate students as part of the Advanced Software Development Methods (CS 3240) course at the University of Virginia in the Fall of 2021. A live version of this web application which is deployed through the Heroku cloud platform can be viewed [here](https://uva-guide-b26.herokuapp.com/).
